1. Customer

3. Proposal date, start date, end date
4. Work items
5. Domains
6. Fees information
7. Billing information
8. Consultants

#### Project state tracking

Projects have 3 different states (Proposal, In progress, Ended).

* In the proposal state, project details are editable, but no documents or messages can be stored.
* In the “In progress” state, project details are no longer editable, documents and messages can be stored for each work item.
* In the “Ended” state, project details and documents are viewable, but they cannot be edited.


#### Document storage pertaining to each work-item of a project

In each work-item, consultants can store messages with documents attached. This allows consultants to keep track of the progress on a more fine-grained level. Documents and messages will now be centralised in a single location.

#### Proposal slides and word document generation

From the details of the project, proposal powerpoint slides and engagement documents can be generated automatically from a given template. This helps consultants save time spent on creating documents.
